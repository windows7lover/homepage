I"T<p>FAST (Finally An SDDP Toolbox) is an easy-to-use Stochastic Dynamic Dual Programming (SDDP) toolbox for Matlab. It helps you to model and solve your problem easily and quickly! The goal of SDDP is to solve large-scale stochastic problems with an algorithm based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting-plane_method">Cutting plane method</a>. <br />
Three typical applications of FAST,</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Energy production</strong> In the energy production domain, FAST allows for accurate solutions when dealing with uncertain energy supply or demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Factory production line</strong> When the demand is unknown, FAST helps you plan your production to maximize your revenue.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial products</strong> FAST allows you to deal with random portfolios in the stock exchange business.</li>
</ul>
