  abstract={Regularized nonlinear acceleration (RNA) estimates the minimum of a function by post-processing iterates from an algorithm such as the gradient method. It can be seen as a regularized version of Anderson acceleration, a classical acceleration scheme from numerical analysis. The new scheme provably improves the rate of convergence of fixed step gradient descent, and its empirical performance is comparable to that of quasi-Newton methods. However, RNA cannot accelerate faster multistep algorithms like Nesterov's method and often diverges in this context. Here, we adapt RNA to overcome these issues, so that our scheme can be used on fast algorithms such as gradient methods with momentum. We show optimal complexity bounds for quadratics and asymptotically optimal rates on general convex minimization problems. Moreover, this new scheme works online, i.e., extrapolated solution estimates can be reinjected at each iteration, significantly improving numerical performance over classical accelerated methods.},

  abstract={In many different fields such as optimization, the performance of a method is often characterized
by its rate of convergence. However, accelerating an algorithm requires a lot of knowledge about
the problem’s structure, and such improvement is done on a case-by-case basis. Many accelerated
schemes have been developed in the past few decades and are massively used in practice. Despite
their simplicity, such methods are usually based on purely algebraic arguments and often do not
have an intuitive explanation.
Recently, heavy work has been done to link accelerated algorithms with other fields of science, such as control theory or differential equations. However, these explanations often rely on
complex arguments, usually using non-conventional tools in their analysis.
One of the contributions of this thesis is a tentative explanation of optimization algorithms
using the theory of integration methods, which has been well studied and enjoys a solid theoretical
analysis. In particular, we will show that optimization scheme are special instance of integration
methods when integrating the classical gradient flow. With standard arguments, we intuitively
explain the origin of acceleration.
On the other hand, accelerated methods usually need additional parameters in comparison
with slower one, which are in most cases difficult to estimate. In addition, these schemes are
designed for one particular setting and cannot be used elsewhere.
In this thesis, we explore a new approach for accelerating optimization algorithms, which
uses generic acceleration arguments. In numerical analysis, these tools have been developed for
accelerating sequences of scalars or vectors, by building on the side another sequence with a
better convergence rate. These methods can be combined with an iterative algorithm, speeding
it up in most cases. In practice, extrapolation schemes are not widely used due to their lack of
theoretical guarantees and their instability. We will extend these methods by regularizing them,
allowing a deeper theoretical analysis and stronger convergence results, especially when applied
to optimization methods.},

However, their efficiency is still not entirely understood even in the quadratic case. In this paper, we clarify the convergence analysis by giving general properties that share several classes of nonlinear acceleration: Anderson acceleration (and variants), quasi-Newton methods (such as Broyden Type-I or Type-II, SR1, DFP, and BFGS) and Krylov methods (Conjugate Gradient, MINRES, GMRES). In particular, we propose a generic family of algorithms that contains all the previous methods and prove its optimal rate of convergence when minimizing quadratic functions. We also propose multi-secants updates for the quasi-Newton methods listed above. We provide a Matlab code implementing the algorithm.},

We define the spectral shape of a family of games as the set containing all eigenvalues of the Jacobians of standard gradient dynamics in the family. Shapes restricted to the real line represent well-understood classes of problems, like minimization. Shapes spanning the complex plane capture the added numerical challenges in solving smooth games. In this framework, we describe gradient-based methods, such as extragradient, as transformations on the spectral shape. Using this perspective, we propose an optimal algorithm for bilinear games. For smooth and strongly monotone operators, we identify a continuum between convex minimization, where acceleration is possible using Polyak’s momentum, and the worst case where gradient descent is optimal. Finally, going beyond first-order methods, we propose an accelerated version of consensus optimization.},

This approach provably exhibits a better rate of convergence than full extra-gradient for non-smooth convex games with noisy gradient oracle. We propose an additional variance reduction mechanism to obtain speed-ups in smooth convex games. Our approach makes extrapolation amenable to massive multiplayer settings, and brings empirical speed-ups, in particular when using a heuristic cyclic sampling scheme.

  abstract={Advances in generative modeling and adversarial learning have given rise to renewed interest in smooth games. However, the absence of symmetry in the matrix of second derivatives poses challenges that are not present in the classical minimization framework. While a rich theory of average-case analysis has been developed for minimization problems, little is known in the context of smooth games. In this work we take a first step towards closing this gap by developing average-case optimal first-order methods for a subset of smooth games. We make the following three main contributions. First, we show that for zero-sum bilinear games the average-case optimal method is the optimal method for the minimization of the Hamiltonian. Second, we provide an explicit expression for the optimal method corresponding to normal matrices, potentially non-symmetric. Finally, we specialize it to matrices with eigenvalues located in a disk and show a provable speed-up compared to worst-case optimal algorithms. We illustrate our findings through benchmarks with a varying degree of mismatch with our assumptions.},

However, these results rely on norm-dependent assumptions, usually incurring non-affine invariant bounds, in contradiction with FW's affine-covariant property. In this work, we introduce new structural assumptions on the problem (such as the directional smoothness) and derive an affine invariant, norm-independent analysis of Frank-Wolfe. Based on our analysis, we propose an affine invariant backtracking line-search. Interestingly, we show that typical backtracking line-searches using smoothness of the objective function surprisingly converge to an affine invariant step size, despite using affine-dependent norms in the step size's computation. This indicates that we do not necessarily need to know the set's structure in advance to enjoy the affine-invariant accelerated rate.},

However, its remarkable empirical success is not fully explained by this optimality, as the worst-case analysis -- contrary to the average-case -- is not representative of the expected complexity of an algorithm. In this work we establish a novel link between PM and the average-case analysis. Our main contribution is to prove that any optimal average-case method converges in the number of iterations to PM, under mild assumptions. This brings a new perspective on this classical method, showing that PM is asymptotically both worst-case and average-case optimal. },

We further cover proximal acceleration, at the heart of the Catalyst and Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient frameworks, using similar algorithmic patterns. Common acceleration techniques rely directly on the knowledge of some of the regularity parameters in the problem at hand. We conclude by discussing restart schemes, a set of simple techniques for reaching nearly optimal convergence rates while adapting to unobserved regularity parameters.},

In exchange, this analysis requires a more precise hypothesis over the data generating process, namely assuming knowledge of the expected spectral distribution (ESD) of the random matrix associated with the problem. This work shows that the concentration of eigenvalues near the edges of the ESD determines a problem's asymptotic average complexity. This a priori information on this concentration is a more grounded assumption than complete knowledge of the ESD. This approximate concentration is effectively a middle ground between the coarseness of the worst-case scenario convergence and the restrictive previous average-case analysis. We also introduce the Generalized Chebyshev method, asymptotically optimal under a hypothesis on this concentration and globally optimal when the ESD follows a Beta distribution. We compare its performance to classical optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent or Nesterov's scheme, and we show that, in the average-case context, Nesterov's method is universally nearly optimal asymptotically.},
