## A brief summary
I am a Ph.D. student in the Sierra Team (since 2015), which is part of the [Computer Science Department](http://www.di.ens.fr/) of [École Normale Supérieure Ulm](http://www.ens.fr/en). 
I am supervised by [Alexandre d'Aspremont](http://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/) and [Francis Bach](http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach). 

Prior to that, I graduated from [École Polytechnique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/facultes/epl) in 2015 and got a Masters Degree in Mathematical Engineering. I did my master thesis in optimization, and my advisor was [Yurii Nesterov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DJ8Ep8YAAAAJ). 

Moreover, I collaborated with [Leopold Cambier](https://people.stanford.edu/lcambier/) and [Anthony Papavasiliou](http://perso.uclouvain.be/anthony.papavasiliou/public_html/) for the creation of the [FAST toolbox](https://web.stanford.edu/~lcambier/fast/), and also with [Raphael Jungers](http://perso.uclouvain.be/raphael.jungers/content/home) and [Julien Hendrickx](https://perso.uclouvain.be/julien.hendrickx/) in the context of the [JSR Toolbox](http://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33202-the-jsr-toolbox).

## Research interests
My main research interest is **convex optimization**, but I am also interested in **numerical analysis**. Here is a (non-exhaustive) selection of research topics:
- *Deterministic and Stochastic Optimization*,
- *Generic Acceleration Methods*,
- *Integration Algorithms for ODE* (and their links with optimization).
