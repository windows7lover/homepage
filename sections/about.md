## A random rumber, just for you!
<pre><code><script>
document.write(">> ")
document.write(Math.round(Math.random().toFixed(2)*100))
</script></code></pre>
Why ? Because this may be useful for someone. Maybe. Anyway, this is a (free) gift, so take it!

## About me

### Where are you from?
I am an element of the set Belgium, more precisely a part of one of its subsets, [Wallonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallonia). My native language is french but I can, of course, speak a perfect broken english.

<br>
### Hobbies

I am a big fan of video games, especially [P0rtal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)). When I want to play alone, I prefer "competitive" games, like [CS:GO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive), [Dota 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2) or the [Battlefield serie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_(video_game_series)).  
However, with my friends, we usually play strategies games. Our favorite ones are [Warcraft III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos), [Warhammer 40k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Games_Workshop_video_games#Warhammer_40.2C000), [Company of Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_of_Heroes), [Homeworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld) and many other. Times to times, it happens that we start a [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) server to create (crazy) stuff.  

While I am thinking, we are still looking for a 4<sup>th</sup> player for Warcraft III! Do not hesitate to contact me if you want ;-).

## My collegues

At Inria, I work under the supervision of [Alexandre d'Aspremont](http://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/) and [Francis Bach](http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach). At the beginning, my office mates were [Amit Bermanis](https://sites.google.com/site/amitbermanis/) and [Nicolas Boumal](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nboumal/#about) but they left 6-9 months after my arrival. Now I am in the same office than [Gauthier Gidel](http://www.di.ens.fr/~gidel/#/), [Antoine Recanati](https://www.di.ens.fr/AntoineRecanati.html.fr), [Vincent Roulet](http://www.di.ens.fr/~roulet/) and Thomas Kerdreux.

During my master, I worked a lot with [LÃ©opold Cambier](https://people.stanford.edu/lcambier/), which is now a Ph.D. student at Standford. For example, we 
created together the [FAST](https://web.stanford.edu/~lcambier/fast/) toolbox for Matlab.

## What softwares you use?

When I work, I prefer to code in Matlab for prototyping. However, sometimes I use C++ when efficiency and speed are important. Finally, for papers, I always use Latex.

For this website, I used an amazing tool called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This allow you to "*code*" your website, then generate it. A good comparison may be done with Latex, which is a programming language to output good PDF files. If you want to have the source code of this website, I invite you to visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/windows7lover/homepage) page.

## You want to lose time?
Sure, who don't? Here is my personnal selection:
- [Super-hexagon](http://terrycavanaghgames.com/hexagon/), in particular if you like polygons.
- [Wolfenstein](http://3d.wolfenstein.com/), a old DOOM-like game.
- The classicals [Ph.D. commics](http://phdcomics.com/), [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) and [smbc](http://www.smbc-comics.com/). But you already know these, isn't it? ;-)
- [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), for the geeks who count in base 2.

## Why the theme of your website is so ugly?

```
The reason is simple, this is b3c4u53 1 l1k3 "d4rk" c0l0r5, 4|\\||) 7|-|!5 7|-|3/\\/\\3 !5 4|_50 q(_)!73 (|_34|\\| (!|\\| 0\\/3|24|_|_). 8|_|+ 4150 83(4|_|53 ! |#331 1!|(3 ! 4|\\/| 4 |-|4(|(3|2 \\|/!+|-| +|-|!5  |\\/|!% 0|# 814(|( 4|\\||) 6|233|\\|!

In any case, I hope you do not work in cryptography, because *I cannot be responsible* for any brain damages caused by the previous message.
