# Damien Scieur's homepage

Welcome! You are free to use any piece of code present in this repo :-).

The link is: [www.damienscieur.com](https://www.damienscieur.com/).

To make this website, I used
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator (really, this is [awesomen](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Awesomen)).
- [Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/tags), version 3.3.7.
- [This theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker), a bit modified.
- [Jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar), for the references.

I would like to say thank to 
- The guy who wrote [this tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/bootstrap-sass-installation-and-customisation/) for using Bootstrap 3 with Jekyll. Rly, u rox.
- [This Stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15917463/embedding-markdown-in-jekyll-html), which explains how to use embeded markdown in html.
