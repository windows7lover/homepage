FAST (Finally An SDDP Toolbox) is an easy-to-use Stochastic Dynamic Dual Programming (SDDP) toolbox for Matlab. It helps you to model and solve your problem easily and quickly! The goal of SDDP is to solve large-scale stochastic problems with an algorithm based on the [Cutting plane method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting-plane_method).   
Three typical applications of FAST,
-  **Energy production** In the energy production domain, FAST allows for accurate solutions when dealing with uncertain energy supply or demand.
- **Factory production line** When the demand is unknown, FAST helps you plan your production to maximize your revenue.
- **Financial products** FAST allows you to deal with random portfolios in the stock exchange business.
