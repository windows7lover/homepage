FAST (Finally An SDDP Toolbox) is an easy-to-use Stochastic Dynamic Dual Programming (SDDP) toolbox for Matlab. It helps you model and solve your problem easily and quickly! The goal of SDDP is solving large-scale stochastic problems, with an algorithm based on the idea of [Cutting plane method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting-plane_method).   
Three typical applications of FAST,
-  **Energy production** In the energy production domain, FAST allows for accurate solutions when dealing with uncertain supply or demand of energy.
- **Factory production line** When the demand is unknow, FAST helps you plan your production to maximize your revenue.
- **Financial products** FAST allows you to efficiently deal with random portfolio in the stock exchange business.
